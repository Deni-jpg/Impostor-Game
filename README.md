# Impostor Word Game

A simple web game to play with friends, built with HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

This project was inspired by my group of friends at church. We used to play this game with paper, and they suggested I create a website for it. That's how this idea came to life! Feel free to contribute to the game :)

## How to Play

1. The host creates a room in `criar-sala.html` by choosing:
   - The secret word
   - Number of players
   - Number of impostors

2. Players join the room using `entrar-sala.html` with the room code.

3. Each player sees either the secret word or that they are an impostor.

4. Players play the game **in person** by describing the word.

5. The host can see a **list of players entering the room**, along with their role (impostor or word holder), updated from the Supabase database.

6. Use the **Restart Game** button in `jogo.html` to reset the room and play again.

## Files

- `index.html` – Landing page with "Create Room" and "Join Room" options
- `criar-sala.html` – Create a new game room and see players joining (powered by Supabase)
- `entrar-sala.html` – Join a room with a code
- `jogo.html` – Player view showing the word or impostor
- `js/supabaseClient.js` – Supabase configuration and client

## Technologies

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for realtime room/player data

## Notes

- Better experience if played in person.
- Player and room data are stored in **Supabase**, allowing multiple devices to see updates.
- No traditional backend is required beyond Supabase.
